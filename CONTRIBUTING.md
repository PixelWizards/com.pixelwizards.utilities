# Contributing

## If you are interested in contributing, here are some ground rules:

    * External contributors can use Github issues for that
* Branch of master for hot fixes, or dev for other works
* Please include the ticket ID in your commits (either Jira or Github issue)


## All contributions are subject to the MIT License
By making a pull request, you are confirming agreement to the terms and conditions of the license, including that your Contributions are your original creation and that you have complete right and authority to make your Contributions.

## Once you have a change ready following these ground rules.
* Before submitting anything, please clean your history (squash, fix-up commits)
* Then create a pull request targeting dev branch and add the issue ID either in the title or the description of the PR.
