# Batch Extract Materials

## What it does

When working with large groups of objects, it is very common to want to extract all of the materials for the objects. Unfortunately Unity does not support batch editing of a selection of objects and, by default, requires that you manually select and manage the materials one by one.

This is very time consuming and painful when working with dozens of objects, which is why the Batch Extract Materials wizard was created.
