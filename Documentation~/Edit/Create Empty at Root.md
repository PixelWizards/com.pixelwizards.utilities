# Create Empty at Root

## What it does

Some times you just want to make a game object a child of another game object. 

That's what this does.

## How do you use this

Similar to the 'Create Empty' option under the Game Object menu (or the right click context menu in the scene hierarchy), this option will add an empty game object and move the selected object underneath as a child game object.
