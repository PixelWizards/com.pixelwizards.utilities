# Replace Selection (Window)

## What it does

There are many times when you need to replace an object (or group of objects) in a scene with another object, but want to keep the position of the existing objects while you do it.

The Replace Selection window is designed to do exactly this.

## How do you use this

1) Select the objects in the Scene View that you want to replace

2. Open the menu **Edit -> Replace Selection**
